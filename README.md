# nvim

**My opinionated neovim configuration.**

## Features

A really cool text editor that lives in your terminal.

## Colorschemes

None come installed by default. I made [dmg](https://github.com/mstcl/dmg) and
[ivory](https://github.com/mstcl/ivory) with
[lush](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim) for my own usage so they are
compiled to Vimscript in `colors` with extensions enabled.

To build these colorschemes, navigate to `~/.config/nvim`, open up neovim and
run `:Shipwright`.
